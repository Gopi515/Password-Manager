# Password Manager


Site is live at - https://gopinath-ghosh-password-manager.netlify.app/

Designed and implemented a robust password generator that empowers
users to create secure passwords tailored to their preferences. Users can
choose from various criteria, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
symbols, numbers, or any combination of these elements. The tool features a
strength indicator that evaluates the security of the generated password.
Additionally, I developed a password management system where users can
securely store their passwords, along with the associated account or service
names. The system also includes functionalities for updating or deleting
saved passwords, ensuring users can efficiently manage their credentials.
